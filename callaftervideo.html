<b>Conversation</b><br />

Hello (insert contacts name). This is (insert reps name) with the Virtual Financial Group.

Did you get a chance to watch the video that we spoke of?<br /><br />

<b>NO.</b> Well, when would be a good time for us to talk after you have had a chance to watch it?<br />

<i>(Deal with the response accordingly.)</i><br /><br />

<b>YES, I DID.</b> Great, what did you like most about it?<br />

<i>(Deal with their response and agree that that is a very special part about what we are doing.)</i><br />

<i>(Discuss a few more points about the video.)</i><br /><br />

The next step in the process is for you to speak with a manager who will show you in more detail how 

are systems work and the great tools that the company makes available to you for you to succeed.<br />

You will need about 30-45 minutes to go through everything and you will need to be in front of a 

computer with internet service. When would be a good time for the call?<br /><br />

<i>(Deal with the response accordingly and go to the Google calendar and set up the time with the manager 

that you are working with.)</i><br />

<i>(Let them know if you will be joining the call or not. Also explain to them that you have just completed 

the responsibilities required for a tier 1.)</i><br /><br />

Excuse yourself from the conversation accordingly.<br /><br />
